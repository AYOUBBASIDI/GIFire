# Contributing to GIFire 🔥

Welcome to the clown car, my friend. Thanks for even *thinking* about contributing to GIFire. You must be truly bored or strangely motivated. Either way, here we are.

We "love" (read: desperately tolerate) contributions and community involvement! 🚀

- Smash some bugs 🐛

## 🧹 Code Style Guidelines You Will Heroically Ignore

- Code so clean that it could be a toothpaste commercial
- Stick to our stack (Prettier/Vite/React) unless you really, *really* hate us
- No dragging in massive libraries like you're decorating a Christmas tree
- GIFire must remain faster than your attention span ⚡

## 🛡 Non-Negotiables

- Don't be a jerk. In issues, PRs, comments, life.
- Always remember: users are busy, distracted goblins who deserve a simple, fast, fun experience
- Spammy PRs will be yeeted into the sun 🙇

👑 **Let's accidentally build something amazing together!** 🚀
