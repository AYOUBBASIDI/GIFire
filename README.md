## ✨ Features (because apparently "basic human decency" wasn't enough)

- 🚀 **Summon the Mighty Overlay** (`Alt+A` unless you enjoy pain)
- 🔎 **Search fresh GIFs** without opening 74 Chrome tabs
- 🔥 **Click to Copy** — no more sad right-click rituals
- ⭐ **Favorite your treasures** and bind them to hotkeys (e.g., `Alt+Q+1`, `Alt+Q+2`, because memory is a myth)
- 🎯 **Custom Hotkeys** (soon... or whenever the dev gets their life together)
- 🔄 **Reset Hotkeys** when you've ruined everything
- ☕ **Tip the Creator** — because coding doesn't pay in exposure (or food)
